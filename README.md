# Computer vision projects

This repo contains my collection of computer vision projects solving real life problems

Watch the video demonstrating the project <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VKAqVmSx60" target="_blank">here</a>

The projects are divided into two categories: 
- Pure image processing using OpenCV; 
- Leveraging from machine learning models
- Machine learning concepts with examples

Image processing:
- Tracking ball using color range to identify the ball
- Card reader
- Document scanner 
- Simple feature detection - finding Waldo project
- Shape identifier
- Image search using color histogram 
- Image duplication identifier
- Image difference finder
- Multi choice test scanner
- Finger counter

Machine learning models:
- Object classification
- Object detection
- Image segmentation
- Car speed monitor
- People counter
- Face detection
- Face parts detection - detecting different parts of the face (eye, nose, eyebrow, mouth, jaw)
- Mask detector
- Image search using ML Autoencoder

Machine learning concepts:
- What are Convolutions
- Visualizing Intermediate Representations from a model

## How to use
- run the `download_assets.py`. This will download all required files for the examples
- Run the Jupyter notebook example you want to test
